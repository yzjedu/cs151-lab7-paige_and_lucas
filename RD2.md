# Reflection Document

* Drive Full Name  : Lucas Podowski
* Partner Full Name: Paige Ronan
* Student ID: 001907164

Objective:
* Designing and programming functions
* Re-using many of the other aspects of Python we've learned so far
* Testing code  
Procedure:
* To find the cost of re-doing five floors we used functions with while loops for error-checking,
if statements for checking the floor type, and a while loop to repeat the functions  
Results: 
* We got what we expected, we used simple test cases  
Reflection:
* One of the challenges we faced was figuring out how to use function parameters.
* We first read and understood the problem. We then planned what we would do to a basic function level, created an
algorithm and followed it to create code. We tested the code to make sure it functioned properly
* We overcame parameters by testing what would work in functions. We then decided it would be easier to 
have empty parameters
* One key takeaway would be better understanding and a review of functions
* I think I did learn what I was supposed to
* Working with Paige was good. We were able to work out the problem despite the troubles of figuring out how to code 
the functions and finished the code well
